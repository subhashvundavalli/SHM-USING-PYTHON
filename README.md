# SHM-USING-PYTHON
SHM means STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING which means monitoring the concrete structure's health 
To check weather the building is strong enough, and to detect the cracks.
if any found on the wall using the python code.
Here we give image as an input and the python runs an algorithm called SOBEL EDGE DETECTOR to find the crack pattern  present in the wall or structure
This system also uses EMBEDED SENSORS to find the Strength of the structure.
We use  a MICRO CONTROLLER named ARDUINO UNO to obtain the data from SENSORS and then using the formula from IS 13311-1992, PART-1 the strength of the structure is given.
ALL THE REPORTS AND CODE AND IMAGES ARE UPLOADED IN THIS REPOSITORY.
